While this app was developed specifically for risk networks, it can also be used for general [Bayesian Network](http://singapore.cs.ucla.edu/LECTURE/lecture_sec1.htm) modeling and analysis. To learn more about our project, see this [publication](http://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/handle/1969.1/153492).\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\nYou can run RiskNetwork in [R](https://www.r-project.org) with:\r\n\r\n```S\r\nrequire(shiny)\r\nrunGitHub('paulgovan/risknetwork')\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr you can access the app through your browser at [paulgovan.shinyapps.io/RiskNetwork](https://paulgovan.shinyapps.io/risknetwork).
